# Introduction
[MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) (abbreviated as MAL) is a social networking platform where people discuss, review, and share information about anime, manga, and the like. It was launched in November 2004 by Garett Gyssler and has since gathered a vast userbase. Users can log and provide detailed information about anime they have watched or want to watch and store them in lists. This project will mainly focus on analyzing the network of users and anime these lists create. Additionally it is explored what makes an anime popular with MAL users and how positive/negative anime reviews are.

The dataset used contains information about 14.478 anime, 302.675 users and 80.076.112 userlist entries. It only has information up until July 2018. Only drama anime will be included and analyzed in the resulting network as there was not enough computer power available to process more.

Reviews were retrieved in December 2020 via the Jikan API and contains reviews up to that point (more information in the explainer notebook).

# Network analysis

First, let's take a look at what makes an anime popular. 



# Download the datasets
The raw data (MAL users, anime and userlists datasets) used can be downloaded form [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist) 

The Kaggle data as well as the reviews dataset and some processed data can be downloaded from google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VxtPMgNMbMo2vSABc_UwTxnidj2SgSi/view?usp=sharing)

# Appendix
The main goals are to provide information about:

- User watching habits and what makes an anime popular based on different parameters (release date, score, etc.)
- How (or whether) users can be separated into meaningful groups given the tags they provide to the MAL platform
- How review sentiments differ based on different parameters (review date, score, etc.)



The data used in this analyzis is mainly based on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) dataset *MyAnimeList Dataset* containing information about $300k$ users, $14k$ anime and $80mil$ ratings from [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net/).

The Kaggle dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist) (last visited 08/12/2020)

Reviews have retrieved from the unofficial MyAnimeList API: [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/).
